0.5		2004-12-01
	Ported to kernel 2.6

0.4.1	2002-01-08
	Fixed a wrap-around bug in trackdev_event().
	tenth of degree must be compared to 1800 not to 180, 3600 must be 
	subtracted, not 360

0.4	2002-01-04
	Major API change.
	Under heavy load conditions, especially MMX/FPU load, itrax.o produces 
	lots of NaNs instead of data. These NaNs occure in the conversion from
	int to float with some float calculations.
 	From now on all data is exported as int. The field "int raw[3]" now 
	delivers the data as received from the hardware without any conversion.
	Converted data is stored in "int tenthdegree[3]". To reach sufficient
	 precision, not degree but tenth of degree are used. 
		tenthdegree = (raw * 1800) / 32768


0.3	2001-10-04

	removed IOCTL for calibrate/uncallibrate
	changed struct trackerposition, callibrated[] removed
	testtracker.c adopted
